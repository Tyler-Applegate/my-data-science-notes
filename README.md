#Git & Github Notes:

- Much easier to create in Github than on the terminal
- If creating on Github, Repo will be autopopulated by Github
    - Need to be in the parent folder, DO NOT CREATE REPO ON TERMINAL!!!
- Get Status... Check every step of the way
- You learn by doing, not by studying.
- Failure is the first/next step in figuring it out.
- Chur that cream into butter ... NO DROWNING!!!
- Be George!!! Ask, ask again, ask until mastery.
